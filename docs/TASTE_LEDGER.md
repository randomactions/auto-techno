# Taste Ledger

## Active direction

Auto Techno should feel dark, hypnotic, authored, and continuously performed. The
kick and bass remain stable physical anchors while upper voices create identity,
tension, mutation, and return. Repetition establishes memory; variation should
sound motivated by phrase structure rather than random replacement. The result
should feel like one machine with intent, not a shuffled library of loops.

Prefer changes that produce a materially audible performance leap: stronger
long-range consequence, recognizable synth character, relational rhythm, and
earned contrast. Avoid marginal control expansion, novelty for its own sake, and
technical polish that is inaudible at matched loudness.

## Rule for new entries

Every musical rule begins with a concrete observation in the form:

> At this moment, this element sounds or feels this way; it should instead do
> this perceptible thing.

Record the canonical-session checkpoint and time region, the smallest
reproducible rule changed, the matched-loudness comparison, and the keep/revert
verdict. Measurements may reject unsafe output but do not replace listening.

## Legacy engineering appendix — current-runtime cleanup, 2026-08-08

Observation: none. This cleanup intentionally does not retune the performance.
The surviving render equations and current autonomous planning path are retained.
Private fixtures 42, 48291, and 90909 produced bit-identical representative-rate
PCM before and after cleanup, so there is no audible difference to approve. These
values are historical engineering fixtures, not product choices or current
acceptance criteria. Any future hash change still requires investigation and the
listening gate. Physical-output smoke testing and soak remain separate pending
states.

## Oscar-informed groove-first candidate — 2026-08-08

Observation source: the supplied Underdog/Oscar production lessons repeatedly
build authority from one coherent pulse, deliberate gaps, stable sound identity,
and infrequent structural contrast. Repository inspection also found that the
ensemble arbiter's events were reported as metadata while the renderer generated
a different onset pattern. This candidate should make the arbitrated groove
audible, reduce unmotivated mutation, and let sparse phrases remain valid.

Canonical listening checkpoints: first macro, first chapter change, contrast,
break, release, and identity return. The smallest reproducible rules are:
resolved-bar event ownership, sixteen-bar punctuation, topology mutation only
for contrast/break phrases, persistent foundation companions, optional low-cut
three-sixteenth echo, Phrygian identity for sufficiently dark scenes, and a
stable motif timbre fingerprint.

Matched-loudness comparison: pending. Physical listening has not been performed.
Verdict: implementation candidate only; do not promote new hashes or claim
musical approval until the canonical comparison is heard and recorded here.

## Oscar-informed interlocking evolution candidate — 2026-08-08

Observation source: the supplied [Oscar video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ41F-uI8AQ)
suggests that a short sequencer can drive a longer follower so simple parts reveal
new relationships over time. Applied here as a hypothesis, not a listening
verdict: the upper voices use a three-step driver advancing a five-stage follower
against the sixteen-step groove. The cycle changes articulation only, never onset
count or position.

The smallest additional rule is a bounded sixteen-bar chapter memory. `home`
preserves the fingerprint, while `breath`, `tone`, `motion`, and `memory` emphasize
envelope, spectrum, resolved-pitch glide, or sparse band-limited pulse echo.
Identity returns force `home`, and no more than four macros may elapse without
it. Foundation voices remain stable and outside both the relational articulation
and upper-voice topology mutation.

Matched-loudness comparison: pending at the canonical checkpoints above. Keep
only if the performance feels progressively revealed rather than busier.
Verdict: pending listening approval.

## Video-informed kick hierarchy candidate — 2026-08-08

Observation: “kick is a little too loud.” The supplied Underdog
[mixing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWgA5l2m2H0) treats level as the
first and strongest hierarchy decision before corrective EQ or compression. The
smallest reproducible rule is therefore a fixed `-1.5 dB` kick fader: regular
level `0.72 → 0.605804` and breakdown level `0.54 → 0.454353`.

The audible kick now feeds the mix, masking analysis, and kick level metadata
after that fader. The existing pre-fader kick continues to drive ducking, so the
pump, transient, decay, rhythm, companion levels, and processing topology do not
change. Automated evidence confirms `-1.5 dB` isolated kick energy, unchanged
resolved kick onsets, and a pre-fader ducking envelope independent of the new
audible level.

Matched-loudness comparison: pending. Listen eyes closed at the first macro,
contrast, break, release, and identity return. Keep only if the kick remains
authoritative while mono rumble and the surrounding groove are easier to hear,
without weakening releases. Verdict: pending; do not promote candidate hashes.

## Automatic kick/foundation hierarchy candidate — 2026-08-09

Observation: “the kick is still a little bit too much in your face,” and the app
waveform appears almost entirely kick. Inspection showed two separate causes:
the musical balance is still kick-forward, while the display independently
normalizes every bar and expands low values, making absolute level relationships
impossible to read.

The smallest reproducible audio rule is a private kick/foundation governor fed
by exact dry role stems. It starts with an additional `-1 dB` kick correction,
moves by no more than `0.35 dB` per prepared bar, stops inside a `0.35 dB`
deadband, never boosts above the authored post-fader kick, and is bounded to
`-3...0 dB`. Authored active-level targets are `16.5 dB` over bass, `27.5 dB`
over mono rumble, and `22.5 dB` over tuned tom. Breaks, empty companions, and
inaudible foundations hold the prior state. The pre-fader ducking detector,
foundation levels, onsets, arrangement, and topology remain unchanged.

Separately, the read-only waveform now maps RMS energy through one fixed
`-48...-6 dB` scale. This corrects the visual evidence without feeding UI state
back into the music. Adding the five measurement stems at unity preserved the
compact first-macro PCM exactly (`e50fdd2d1d020804`). Enabling the governor
changed that diagnostic render to `35a6c0e5d4bb271c`, with RMS `0.0835107` and
peak `0.4143651`; the canonical mono-rumble relationship settled at about
`27.73 dB`, inside the target deadband.

Matched-loudness comparison: pending. Keep only if the kick remains authoritative
but no longer crowds the rumble and surrounding groove. Expanding automatic gain
control to percussion or upper voices remains out of scope until this first
relationship is heard and accepted. Verdict: implementation candidate only; do
not promote hashes.
